Modificacion of the Android aplication of Bitwarden, a password manager on the cloud, with the objective of adding support for InputStick, a Bluetooth \gls{usb} receiver that simulates a \gls{hid} keyboard. This would make possible to type a password in devices compatible with the \gls{hid} standard through \gls{usb}, that do not have a Bitwarden client installed and without the need to use the web-interface client. This way we would accomplish the feat of avoiding writing the master password in an untrusted device so the only password that could be compromised would be the one needed at the moment.
